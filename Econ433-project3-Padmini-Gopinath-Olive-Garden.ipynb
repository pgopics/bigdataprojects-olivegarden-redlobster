This benchmark chain could be a major competitor of your own chain, a chain that your chain aspires to grow into, or a chain that your chain may want to acquire for future business. Whatever your choice is, explain why you make this choice and what you would like to learn most by comparing your own chain with this benchmark chain.\n",

This is because similar to how Olive Garden specializes in a specific type of cuisine, Italian food, Red Lobster also specializes in a specific type of cuisine, seafood.

    "the number of observations are slightly different when they are collasped into a new data-set by state-day. this makes sense because when defining the intial datasets the number of observations in the focal_long dataset > number of observations in the benchmark_long dataset. In addition, the number of unique chain units and the number of unique states in focal_long is > the number of unique chain units and the number of unique states in benchmark_long. so it is consistent with my expectation"

Economic meaning for Post03132020 is 0.0357 and is not statistically signficant -> economically meaning that there is not enough evidence to suggest that the number of daily visits has changed after march 13 2020. Blue Post coefficient is also negative and less than p <0.05 meaning that the combined effect of being a blue state and the period after march 13th 2020 is associated with further decrease in natural logarithm of daily visits plus one meaning that on average number of daily visits is lower in the Blue Post case. In terms of the null hypothesis: H0: The national emergency announced on March 13, 2020, does not make a difference on average SumDailyVisits of your own chain between red and blue states\" , we can reject it because the Blue Post coefficent is signficant and has a p value < 0.05. the non signficant POST03132020 variable shows that a national emergency solemly didn't change the average SumDailyVisits."
